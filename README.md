# YOLOv5
Welcome to YOLOv5 - a simple yet powerful object detection model based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture. This repository contains all the resources you need to get started with YOLOv5 quickly and efficiently.



# üöÄ What is YOLOv5?
YOLOv5 is an open-source deep learning framework that aims to provide state-of-the-art object detection performance in real-time. It's built upon the YOLO architecture, known for its speed and accuracy in detecting objects in images and videos. YOLOv5 brings several improvements over its predecessors, making it more efficient and easier to use.


# üîë Key Features
  -Simplicity: YOLOv5 is designed to be easy to use and deploy, with minimal dependencies.
    -Speed: It offers real-time inference speeds suitable for a wide range of applications.
  -Accuracy: YOLOv5 achieves high levels of accuracy on various object detection tasks.
    -Flexibility: The framework supports customization and fine-tuning for specific use cases.
  -Scalability: It can be easily scaled to different hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs and accelerators.
